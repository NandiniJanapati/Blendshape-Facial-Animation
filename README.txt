This was the third assignment I completed for my Computer Animation class at Texas A&M
The goal was to animate a face model using blendshapes to seamlessly transition between different expressions.

Switch between expressions using 's'
play animation with spacebar

Meshes and blendshapes taken from Faceware Technologies

My vertex shader only supports 3 separate blendshapes loaded in at a time per emotion.

To my knowledge I completed all parts of the assignment, excluding the extra credit.
